# 🛳️ Battleship Web Game

A simple battleship game built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to practice basic web development concepts. The player competes against the computer in a classic grid-based naval strategy game.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Each player (you and the computer) places ships on a hidden grid.
- Take turns attacking grid cells.
- A hit damages the ship; a miss does nothing.
- The first to destroy all of the opponent’s ships wins!
